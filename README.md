I tried to roughly mimic game engine components such as gameobjects, transforms, colliders, rigidbodies for this assignment.

I use conservaton of momentum and angular momentum principles to simulate the collisions and adjust the object velocities and angular velocities.

My test file spawns a specified number of objects within the bounds at random locations and assigns them a random velocity and angular velocity based on the specified ranges given in the test file along with other physical properties.

To show the robustness of my system, I also shoot multiple large and heavy objects via keyboard input during the demo to show how they accurately interact with the environment.
